### Combine with other Syntax themes

This one was combined with [Syntax theme](https://atom.io/themes/one-dark-syntax), I put special attention in glow effects in classes , functions, parameters,vars.
Also in gutter and gutter line number to see easily

### Install

Go to __Settings > Install__ then select __Themes__ and search __hyper alien theme__, __download__ both __ui and syntax__ .
